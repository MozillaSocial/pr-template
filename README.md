# Mozilla Social Pull Request Review Guidelines

PR reviews are we get to share and discuss code before we deliver features to our users. The review step should be meaningful, informative, interesting, and a key element of the continuous improvement of both our codebase and our relations with each other as a team.

## Goals of PR review

PR review should enhance the following goals and values:

- Code Quality: Code reviews help identify and address logic errors, bugs, code style departures, and security vulnerabilities. It helps to both ensure that code being merged meets our quality standards, and helps us to evolve those standards.
- Knowledge Sharing: Reviews are the main forum for discussions of real code, and should facilitate elevated conversations across the team. PR reviews provide an opportunity for develops to learn from one another, share best practices, and gain insights into the different parts of the codebase. 
- Consistency: Reviews help ensure that the whole team follows the same conventions and coding standards, leading to a more readable and maintainable codebase.
- Collaboration and Feedback: Code reviews provide a platform for constructive feedback, discussions, and ideas that can lead to better solutions and continuous improvement.
- Codebase Health: Code reviews can help us prevent technical debt and help identify both risky low-quality code, and areas for improvement in our developmebt process and tooling.
- Onboarding and Knowledge Transfer: Reviews help us onboard new team members by exposing them to our codebass and practices.
